# Better Doors

A Minecraft 1.6.4 legacy fabric mod that makes handling of wood and iron doors more comfortable.
It provides you with the same behavior for crafting and inventory use as has been in the game since version 1.8.

- crafting yields three wood or iron doors instead of one
- you can now stack wood and iron doors up to 64 per stack
